# Python-Text-Translation
Translating texts from English to other languages in Python using googletrans.<br>
Here is my simple code to translate the texts from English to other languages, and also translating back them in English.<br>
I have used googletrans library for completing the above tasks.
If you don't have googletrans, then you can download it by typing: <br>
"pip install googletrans" in your Command Prompt or Anaconda Prompt.<hr>
<b>Note: You would need an active internet in order to run this code.</b><br>
